# atac-seq-clustering
The goal of this project is to try different clustering methods
on ATAC-seq data, compare them and document the results.
Currently we're working on implementing **k-Means, DBSCAN, GMM**
and **Mean Shift** clustering. Other clustering methods
will most likely be included in this list before the end
of the lab. For the comparison we're using **ARI, NMI, Silhouette**
and **Homogenity** scores, as well as **runtime and memory consumption**.
